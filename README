MacAssistant 2012 README

This application is a Manager Assistant app for Sports Interactive's Football Manager
series. It will ideally support all Football Manager games, but will start work on 2012
and will maybe get a fully working release for FM 2013. It will only be an assistant
and not an editor, but editing functionality will be added in the future (don't ask when).

Further future enhancements include server client apps across platforms.

This application is based on littleblue50's fmsx code, released for FM 2011 on
google code (http://code.google.com/p/fmsx/)
